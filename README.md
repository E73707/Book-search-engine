# Book Search Engine <img src = 'https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-red'/>

## description

A MERN stack application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. Users can create an account, save books to their list, and manage their saved books. The application has been refactored to use Apollo Server and GraphQL for API queries and mutations, replacing the previous RESTful API implementation.
